## Objective: 
Our CE research focuses on four subtopics, with the primary purpose of demonstrating why NP problems in polynomial time are too complicated to resolve. We developed the concept by introducing Hilbert's and Gödel's theorems by discussing the relationship between Gödel's theorem and the Turing machine. Furthermore, we addressed non-recursive problems using a few instances, which helped us conclude the NP problem's complexity theory in polynomial time.
## Subtopic: 
    1.	Which theorems are extracted from Turing’s result by Gödel?
    2.	How do you identify that a particular problem is non-recursive?
    3.	Why is there no algorithm to solve NP problems in polynomial time? Would we ever be able to find such an algorithm?
    4.	Why NP Problem in polynomial time is too complex to be solved?
